# üéØ Habits Tracker & Pomodoro App

This project is a web application designed to help users **build and maintain positive habits** while integrating the productivity-boosting **Pomodoro Technique**.

It allows users to **track their daily progress on custom habits** and utilize a focused timer for work sessions.

## ‚ú® Project Context

This application represents a point in my development where I aimed to build a practical tool for personal use and learning. It's a combination of features I find valuable: structured work intervals (Pomodoro) and consistent self-improvement tracking (Habits).

Building this project involved tackling aspects like:

*   Designing a user interface for managing lists and tracking progress.
*   Implementing timer logic.
*   Handling data storage and retrieval for habits and sessions.
*   Creating a user-friendly experience for daily interaction.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Habit Management:** Add new habits, customize their names, frequencies, or other relevant properties.
*   **Daily Tracking:** Mark habits as completed for specific days.
*   **Progress Visualization:** View your history and consistency for each habit.
*   **Integrated Pomodoro Timer:** Use a customizable timer directly within the application to structure focused work sessions.
*   **Data Persistence:** Save your habits and tracking history for long-term use.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be usable and visually appealing across **various devices, including mobile phones**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **React:** The core library for the user interface.
*   **Redux:** For managing application state.
*   **Styled Components:** For component-scoped styling.
*   **Firebase:**
    *   **Firebase Authentication:** For user login (Google Auth).
    *   **Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore:** For storing user data and sessions.
*   **Storybook:** For UI component development and documentation.
*   **Axios:** A Promise-based HTTP client (likely used for interactions outside of pure Firebase SDK calls, if any, or within Cloud Functions).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Project Status

Please be aware that this project was developed **some time ago** and relies on **older versions of its dependencies** (Gatsby framework, various libraries).

As a result, the code in its current state **will likely require significant work to update dependencies** and resolve compatibility issues before it can be successfully built or run.

This repository is kept as a **historical record of my learning and work** at that time, demonstrating the original architecture, styling choices, and the technologies I was exploring.
